=================
This repo is designed to combine the functionality of [firrtl-operations](https://github.com/ucsc-vama/firrtl-operations/tree/main) and [firrtl-sig](https://github.com/ucsc-vama/firrtl-sig) to test the accuracy of each operation. Python program will generate a test case in C++ code. Compiling and running the c++ code will yield the accuracy test of U-int and S-int operations in firrtl-sig.

run test script:

    $ python test.py

NOTES:

* uints of different bit length cannot be calculated. slight issue on firrtl sig
* test creates random values and will therefore have slight chance of error when two equal numbers were generated by accident
